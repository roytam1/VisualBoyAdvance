After extracting the code from CVS, be sure to do the following if you
are using the configure script:

./fix-timestamps

Failure to do so will result in problems during compilation on systems
that have newer versions of GNU automake/autoconf. This is caused by 
the fact that CVS processes files in alphabetical order and doesn't
keep timestamps. This does not happen on source distributions.

If you need to regenerate those files, do in this order:

aclocal
autoconf
automake -a -c
