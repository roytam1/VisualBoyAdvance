After extracting the code from CVS, be sure to do the following if you
are using the configure script:

touch `find . -name Makefile.in`

Failure to do so will result in problems during compilation on systems
that have newer versions of GNU automake/autoconf.

If you need to regenerate those files, do in this order:

aclocal
autoconf
automake -a -c
