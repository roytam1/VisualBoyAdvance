System requirements
-------------------

Fast computer (Pentium III 500 Mhz recommended) and Microsoft DirectX 7 or
greater.

Translations
------------

Translations can be done as long as you have Microsoft Visual VC++ on
your computer.

If you just want to use a translation, place the translation .DLL on
the same directory as the emulator. From the Options->Language menu,
select Other... and type the three letter (or two) language name from
.DLL. For example, VBA_PTB.DLL: type PTB on the dialog.

These translation files are only for VisualBoyAdvance GUI and messages.
Games will not be translated and cannot be translated by the emulator.

FAQ
---

See online FAQ for more information: http://vboy.emuhq.com/faq.shtml

Please don't email about what you think it is problem before consulting
the FAQ.

Reporting a crash
-----------------

If VisualBoyAdvance crashes, please do the following:

1. Win 95/98/ME: start DrWatson (drwatson.exe) and reproduce the crash.
DrWatson will capture the crash information in a log file (.wlg) file that
needs to be sent to me. Please also open the .wlg file on your machine by
double-clicking and copy the details section into the email. Microsoft
made life harder when you migrate to WinXP (or NT or 2000) by not allowing
DrWatson to read its old file format.

2. Win NT/2000/XP: make sure DrWatson is the default debugger by executing
drwtsn32.exe -i and then recreate the crash. DrWatson will generate a log file
that needs to be sent to me (usually in c:\Documents and Settings\All Users\
Documents\DrWatson). Depending on your system configuration, you may be asked
if you want to generate a log file. If so, please click on yes.

Warranty
--------

VisualBoyAdvance comes with no warranty. Use it at your own risk.

Contact
-------

Please don't email unless you found some bug. Requests will be ignored and
deleted. Also, be descriptive when emailing. You have to tell me what version
of the emulator you are writing about and a good description of the problem.
Remember, there is a SDL version, a Windows version, a Linux version and a
BeOS version.
Also, there are still people writing about the old VisualBoy which is no longer
supported. Also remember I am not paid to work on VisualBoyAdvance.

This is just a hobby.
