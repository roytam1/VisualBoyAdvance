What is this?
-------------

VisualBoyAdvance is a Nintendo (TM) Gameboy and GameboyAdvance emulator with
debugging capabilities.

How to compile the source
-------------------------

1. Unix
-------

The following software is needed in order to compile:

- libpng: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
- zlib: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
- libSDL: http://www.libsdl.org
- nasm (optional for x86 MMX support): http://nasm.sourceforge.net/

Unpack the sources from the tar.gz file, then run the configure script. The
following extra options may be used to configure the generated executables:

--enable-c-core (--disable-c-core): enables the C core instead of x86 core
--enable-dev (--disable-dev): enables the development features (slower)
--enable-gp (--disable-gp): enables GP32 emulation
--with-mmx (--without-mmx): enables MMX support

After configure completes, just issue the make command. If it all goes well,
you will have the emulator compiled in the src directory. Issuing the
make install command will install the executables into the /usr/local/bin
directory (subject to change).

The emulator code should work in both big and little endian computers, but
it has not been tested yet in big endian machines enough.

2. Windows
----------

Needed software:
- nasm: see above for URL. Install it in the default directory
- Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or greater: to compile

The win32 directory contains Microsoft Visual Studio workspace files needed
to compile the project with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or greater. The gba.dsp
workspace compiles the full Windows version and gba_sdl.dsp compiles the
Windows SDL version.

The Windows version contains three possible configurations:
- Debug: full debugging of the emulator is possible
- Release: optimized version for GBA developers
- ReleaseNoDev: optimized version without development features
